# Lumetri scope display
Convert an image to show up in a lumetri scope.

Lumetri scopes are a type of [histogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_histogram) in Adobe Premiere, After Effects & co.
They are used to inform the color correction process. Usually they don't look like an actual image, just a distribution of dots.

The code in this repo converts a given image (sequence) in a way that makes the image(s) show up in the Waveform or Spectogram display:
